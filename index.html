                Modern linguists look to ancient Indian linguistics
            </h2>

            <p>
                A deeper understanding and innovation in linguistic theory is the aim of merging expertise and insights from the fields of ancient Indian and modern Western linguistics. The results of such an investigation will further advance linguistic science.
            </p>
            <p>
                The EU-funded LINGUINDIC project will systematically explore and analyse the neglected riches of ancient Indian linguistic thought. It will also uncover lost linguistic insights and analyses, as well as build on these insights to create innovative approaches to contemporary issues in modern Western linguistics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the project will focus on ancient Indian contributions to linguistic thought in three broad areas: morphosyntax and formal language systems, semantics/pragmatics and the philosophy of language, and phonetics/phonology.
